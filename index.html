        <h2>Touchdown! Christmas Eve in NYC!</h2>
        <h4>December 24, 2022</h4>
        <p>
          Merry Christmas everybody! Just landed in NYC this morning and will be here for 11 days!
          <br>
          <br>
          Will keep this very brief. It's been a while since I've updated this blog, but a lot has changed in life. Met my significant other, Co! I'm here with her right now and
          we have a full on itinerary for this trip. Should be a lot fun!
          <br>
          <br>
          Work has been a roller coaster of ups and downs, but I'm very happy of the team that I'm working in. The work is very challenging and I was not expecting to see a lot of
          backend work, so thank you Ravi, Naresh, Alex, Anthony, Suba, Vivian and Anandhi for taking the time to explain things in the business scope and developers lens.
          <br>
          <br>
          At this point in time, I just want to give thanks to God. Give all the glory to the man above. Wish you all a very merry Christmas!

        <h2>The Dream of 2017 Finally Came True</h2>
        <h4>June 09, 2022</h4>
        <p>
          I start my first day at Fannie Mae today as a Software Developer!
          <br>
          <br>
          I made it through Revature's training and staging program, had my interview with the manager a few weeks back and Revature got back to me with an offer! Woot woot.
          Major shout out to Alexa, my point of contact, who vouched for me. I appreciate you.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you believe in something hard enough, it <strike>might</strike> actually come true.
          <br>
          <br>
          I don't know everything in this field and I for sure will have to weather many storms, at times tsunamis, but hey I'll tell you one thing. It's gonna take more
          that to knock me down! In all seriousness, learning is a life long process and resourcefullness goes a long way. Knowing where to look and how to sift through information
          is half of the reason how I got here in the first place. Asking questions and cementing what I learned into writing the code, then repeat. I just want to keep getting better.
          <br>
          <br>
          It's insane the number of times I've fallen and had to get back up. Case and point, it's not about the number of times you've fallen but the number of times you got back up.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is the real world now and a lot is underway! Wish me luck!

        <h2>It's Just One of Those Days</h2>
        <h4>March 10, 2022</h4>
        <p>
          If the title of this post isn't anymore of a giveaway to how this day is going.
          <br>
          <br>
          It literally is just one of those off days, though, and it's in these instances where one has to weather the
          storm. I might have cheated myself and had a smash burger, but I'm glad that I'm a lot more aware of these situations
          and surprisingly a lot more collected than my former self. Pat on the back for that.
          <br>
          <br>
          I've participated into this Lent season. First one since I can remember, honestly, I can't even tell you when
          the last time
          I've gone to ash wednesday. If there is one lesson I've learned about this season of lent so far, that's the
          sacrifices
          you've got to make. We all have to make sacrfices every once in a while.
          <br>
          <br>
          Let's start this sacrifice I'm making by attempting to work in the dining room at 19:08 on a Thursday. The
          television is on. Jeopardy
          is playing. Everyone is going about their own thing. Eating dinner, random but loud background noises. You
          know this is the
          same dining room where I'd do my homework in my adolescent days. Now I have a better understanding as to why I
          was always distracted.
          These noises will serve any human as a distraction. Just weather the storm. Focus harder and get some work in.
          <br>
          <br>
          Speaking of work, that's all I do. My code didn't run today and thankfully, only a part of it. The feeling of
          your code not running is never
          a pleasant one. I wish I caught the bug early on during work, but that didn't happen. It's alright, no big
          deal. We'll figure it out later.
          <br>
          <br>
          It's the 6th week of Revature's training, and the following weeks to come are (as I expect) to be the hardest
          and most gruelling. Complex projects but
          the front end is finally included, and that's more of a relief than a burden. The funny thing is: I expected
          to work more with the front-end after
          Coding Dojo's program, but all I've pretty much done til this point is all back-end logic. Endless conditional
          statements. I'm trying
          to find time on the side for more practice, but there's always a catchup game to be played. This week is to
          drill 3 weeks worth of
          concepts into my head for next week's Quality Control check. Fun.
          <br>
          <br>
          It's funny how when you're stressed, it seems like it's only happening to you, but I'm sure that my batch
          mates also feel the struggle of
          keeping up with the intensity. Breathe, pals. We're gonna get through this one day and one line of code at a
          time. That's pretty much it for tonight's
          Time for another night of memory drills, which is what most of this weekend will look like. In the mean time,
          stay easy.

        <h2>To school or not to school?</h2>
        <h4>March 8, 2022</h4>
        <p>
          As I sit here completing an algorithm that is still tough for me to grasp without googling, I think I'm gonna
          take
          the chance and apply for college courses to get the necessary practice and repitition in.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now that I think about it, I feel as though school might be the only place that is truly the hardest to google
          answers,
          especially on an exam day. Exam day's are special. It really puts your brain to work. The grueling hours of
          studying behind
          those books, the endless pool of notes that seem to be useful and not so useful, damn, I actually miss being
          tested like that.
          <br>
          <br>
          6 years later after graduating is the time I find appreciation for those standardized tests that I once used
          to
          hate.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm starting to believer school is a sanctuary for our brain power to be revved up and firing on all
          cylinders.
          <br>
          <br>
          With that being said, I'm most likely going to pursue a another certficate to help me solidify a more firm
          base to
          this industry of endless possibility. I've gotta keep reminding myself that as much as Revature gives you the
          opportunity and
          experience (even though it feels very fast track at times), the basic essentials should not be overlooked. And
          this is only
          a self-reminder.

        <h2>Officially a Software Developer</h2>
        <h4>March 1, 2022</h4>
        <p>
          Time flies.
          <br>
          <br>
          Pretty insane that it's my 5th week working and training with Revature. There's always a constant stress every
          week -- Quality Control checks, assignments and projects, alogrithm challenges and quizzes. Sheesh.
          <br>
          <br>
          As the old saying goes, it ain't worthwhile without having to go through bumps and bruises. This certainly
          feels like
          one of those cliche sayings, and I'm smack dab in the middle of it. I just have to remind myself that this is
          a long-term
          investment, and that knowledge will always have to be updated. In this ever changing world with technology
          having a good grip
          on us, we gotta work incredibly faster and smarter to keep up.
          <br>
          <br>
          In recent days I've been feeling the case of imposter syndrome. The funny thing is, in this industry, even the
          guys with
          years of experience can still feel imposter syndrome. I guess this is field was made for me, since I've always
          fell into the
          category of people of just not knowing 100% -- but will go from one end of the earth to other just to find the
          answers.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's sort-of always been my personality type -- chasing answers, failing along the way, getting up and going
          for another round -- not
          knowing the outcome but having the belief it will work out with grit, grind, passion and tenacity. Thos
          characteristic traits
          have never really been imbedded into me, but I've always been curious to see what the outcome will be if I
          learned how to be all those
          things. I'm still on that journey, unafraid to see what's on the other side.
          <br>
          <br>
          On that note, it's already March! This month is gonna be even more intense than February. Just breathe and put
          in the time
          and repititon. Trust the process.

        <h2>First post of 2022..</h2>
        <h4>February 23, 2022</h4>
        <p>
          Wow -- This word has stuck with me since childhood and it's an expression you can never go wrong with.
          <br>
          <br>
          There's a lot going on leading up to this part of the post alone. Let's break it down a bit. It's been nearly
          3
          months
          since I last pushed a blog post and since then, I quit Amazon -- only lasted there for a few weeks. Didn't
          really feel like
          working during the holidays, and that's exactly what I did -- not work and celebrate with family. Well worth
          it, but
          my credit cards say otherwise.
          <br>
          <br>
          I now work for Revature! A company that chews you up for little pay and moves you around the country where
          need be (after training).
          I'm in training right now and boy, is it starting to really feel like hell -- deadlines, weekly assessments,
          weekly oral interview-style
          test questions about what you've learned in the past week, coding projects and I'm stressing over the first
          one due in one week from now.
          <br>
          <br>
          Work is fully remote and now I can see why Americans have fallen in love with this "work-environment." It's
          almost too comforting, but I hope
          I'm able to move with Revature and actually go out the east of this country. And while I might not be
          explaining
          too much about the company I work for,
          that isn't really the point of this post. It's really just to rant as to what's happened with my code and this
          blog in the last few months.
          <br>
          <br>
          This project that's due in a month is critical to this training program and I'm just really hoping to perform
          well and make my code the most functional
          it could be. I'm coding in Java and it's all back-end logic. And here I was thinking I'm going to be a
          front-end developer. What a sudden change of life
          events in just these few months alone. I didn't really have to shotgun approach the application process, since
          Revature reached out, made me take an assesment,
          and in January I settled all the paper to hit the ground running the first of Feb.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's all I really have for tonight, and I can't forget these newly-create principles to live by, and that's
          to commit my code a lot more often. We live
          in a world where our social media presence is tracked and surprisingly enough, you can still do that in a
          positive manner, which I'm trying my best to practice.

        <h2>Officially an Amazonian!</h2>
        <h4>December 5, 2021</h4>
        <p>I just started working at Amazon. It’s refreshing to be back on the payroll, but even more so to be working
          with people again. I forgot how organized and procedural the American system is when it comes to work. I’ve
          literally not worked in this country for the last 5 years, while being abroad in China but more on that later.
          To clarify, I work as a warehouse associate packing and inspecting your guys’ packages! Making sure your items
          aren’t damaged and if it is, reporting it in a timely manner. There’s a whole gang of employees working in
          different departments of the warehouse. It’s fascinating to see how everything operates inside. That’s the
          biggest reason I took on this job.
          <br>
          <br>
          It’s training week, but so far everything from cleanliness, lighting, coloring, safety precautions and general
          work environment vibe checks out. The atmosphere in there is a bunch of young adults aged from 18-34 and to
          keep things lively and not so dull and repetitive, the warehouse is blasted with 90s classic jams. It almost
          feels like a club in there.
          <br>
          <br>
          I only realized during the orientation how much benefits Amazon employees receives. They have an incentive
          where if you work with them for a year full-time, you get qualified for a tuition reimbursement of up to
          $12-13k with the assistance of placing you in a career track. The absurd amount of PTO they give you, even for
          part-time employees like myself, is another cool perk.
          <br>
          <br>
          In all honesty, one of the first things I thought of stepping inside with my yellow vest, gloves and
          protective gear -- not to mention all the delivery sprinter vans lined up outside of the warehouse -- was
          Squid Game.
          <br>
          <br>
          Catch you guys in the next one, see ya!

        <h2>Blog Post #1</h2>
        <h4>December 3, 2021</h4>
        <p>Hi everyone! This is the beta version of the ‘Bloggy Vloggy’ written blog that I’ll slowly work and
          build upon. In other words, this website is a home for my thoughts!
          <br>
          <br>
          You guys have been familiar with my content in the short-video format on Instagram stories and
          Snapchat -- my infamous use of the Rio De Janeiro filter and so forth. Having a written and (I’m
          hoping) heartfelt passage or journal entry should be a good change of pace. Plus, I’m still creating
          content in a different way by also building the website from scratch. Using mostly HTML and CSS, as
          well as Github pages to generate this website, it’ll be a good starting point to this journey I’m
          about to embark on.
          <br>
          <br>
          Just to dive a little deeper into my thoughts, and simply put, I’m trying to break into the tech
          industry and make that $BANK. More importantly, I could say that I enjoy coding. The pursuit of
          anything is always going to require passion. I’m also a believer of the growth mindset, and this
          industry will prove how resilient I am to that belief because of the never-ending updates to all
          programming languages.
          <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, I had just completed a coding bootcamp and I’m pretty invested into this industry. My
          thinking is that there’s a silver lining through it all. I already enjoy making content, so now
          let’s add some code on top of it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout the journey, I hope to gain insight, feedback to what you guys think I can improve on.
          The famous saying once goes, “There’s light at the end of the tunnel.” To be honest, I like the
          saying “What’s done in the dark shines in the light” a bit more. Hard work never goes unnoticed, and
          that wraps it up for this first blog post!
