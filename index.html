        <h2>Blog Post #1</h2>
        <h4>December 3, 2021</h4>
        <p>Hi everyone! This is the beta version of the ‘Bloggy Vloggy’ written blog that I’ll slowly work and
          build upon. In other words, this website is a home for my thoughts!
          <br>
          <br>
          You guys have been familiar with my content in the short-video format on Instagram stories and
          Snapchat -- my infamous use of the Rio De Janeiro filter and so forth. Having a written and (I’m
          hoping) heartfelt passage or journal entry should be a good change of pace. Plus, I’m still creating
          content in a different way by also building the website from scratch. Using mostly HTML and CSS, as
          well as Github pages to generate this website, it’ll be a good starting point to this journey I’m
          about to embark on.
          <br>
          <br>
          Just to dive a little deeper into my thoughts, and simply put, I’m trying to break into the tech
          industry and make that $BANK. More importantly, I could say that I enjoy coding. The pursuit of
          anything is always going to require passion. I’m also a believer of the growth mindset, and this
          industry will prove how resilient I am to that belief because of the never-ending updates to all
          programming languages.
          <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, I had just completed a coding bootcamp and I’m pretty invested into this industry. My
          thinking is that there’s a silver lining through it all. I already enjoy making content, so now
          let’s add some code on top of it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout the journey, I hope to gain insight, feedback to what you guys think I can improve on.
          The famous saying once goes, “There’s light at the end of the tunnel.” To be honest, I like the
          saying “What’s done in the dark shines in the light” a bit more. Hard work never goes unnoticed, and
          that wraps it up for this first blog post!
