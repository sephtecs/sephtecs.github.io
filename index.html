        <h2>Blog Post #1</h2>
        <h4>December 3, 2021</h4>
        <p>Hi everyone! This is the beta version of the ‘Bloggy Vloggy’ written blog that I’ll slowly work and
          build upon. In other words, this website is a home for my thoughts!
          <br>
          <br>
          You guys have been familiar with my content in the short-video format on Instagram stories and
          Snapchat -- my infamous use of the Rio De Janeiro filter and so forth. Having a written and (I’m
          hoping) heartfelt passage or journal entry should be a good change of pace. Plus, I’m still creating
          content in a different way by also building the website from scratch. Using mostly HTML and CSS, as
          well as Github pages to generate this website, it’ll be a good starting point to this journey I’m
          about to embark on.
          <br>
          <br>
          Just to dive a little deeper into my thoughts, and simply put, I’m trying to break into the tech
          industry and make that $BANK. More importantly, I could say that I enjoy coding. The pursuit of
          anything is always going to require passion. I’m also a believer of the growth mindset, and this
          industry will prove how resilient I am to that belief because of the never-ending updates to all
          programming languages.
          <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, I had just completed a coding bootcamp and I’m pretty invested into this industry. My
          thinking is that there’s a silver lining through it all. I already enjoy making content, so now
          let’s add some code on top of it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout the journey, I hope to gain insight, feedback to what you guys think I can improve on.
          The famous saying once goes, “There’s light at the end of the tunnel.” To be honest, I like the
          saying “What’s done in the dark shines in the light” a bit more. Hard work never goes unnoticed, and
          that wraps it up for this first blog post!

        <h2>Officially an Amazonian!</h2>
        <h4>December 5, 2021</h4>
        <p>I just started working at Amazon. It’s refreshing to be back on the payroll, but even more so to be working
          with people again. I forgot how organized and procedural the American system is when it comes to work. I’ve
          literally not worked in this country for the last 5 years, while being abroad in China but more on that later.
          To clarify, I work as a warehouse associate packing and inspecting your guys’ packages! Making sure your items
          aren’t damaged and if it is, reporting it in a timely manner. There’s a whole gang of employees working in
          different departments of the warehouse. It’s fascinating to see how everything operates inside. That’s the
          biggest reason I took on this job.
          <br>
          <br>
          It’s training week, but so far everything from cleanliness, lighting, coloring, safety precautions and general
          work environment vibe checks out. The atmosphere in there is a bunch of young adults aged from 18-34 and to
          keep things lively and not so dull and repetitive, the warehouse is blasted with 90s classic jams. It almost
          feels like a club in there.
          <br>
          <br>
          I only realized during the orientation how much benefits Amazon employees receives. They have an incentive
          where if you work with them for a year full-time, you get qualified for a tuition reimbursement of up to
          $12-13k with the assistance of placing you in a career track. The absurd amount of PTO they give you, even for
          part-time employees like myself, is another cool perk.
          <br>
          <br>
          In all honesty, one of the first things I thought of stepping inside with my yellow vest, gloves and
          protective gear -- not to mention all the delivery sprinter vans lined up outside of the warehouse -- was
          Squid Game.
          <br>
          <br>
          Catch you guys in the next one, see ya!
