        <h2>Blog Post #1</h2>
        <h4>December 3, 2021</h4>
        <p>Hi everyone! This is the beta version of the ‘Bloggy Vloggy’ written blog that I’ll slowly work and
          build upon. In other words, this website is a home for my thoughts!
          <br>
          <br>
          You guys have been familiar with my content in the short-video format on Instagram stories and
          Snapchat -- my infamous use of the Rio De Janeiro filter and so forth. Having a written and (I’m
          hoping) heartfelt passage or journal entry should be a good change of pace. Plus, I’m still creating
          content in a different way by also building the website from scratch. Using mostly HTML and CSS, as
          well as Github pages to generate this website, it’ll be a good starting point to this journey I’m
          about to embark on.
          <br>
          <br>
          Just to dive a little deeper into my thoughts, and simply put, I’m trying to break into the tech
          industry and make that $BANK. More importantly, I could say that I enjoy coding. The pursuit of
          anything is always going to require passion. I’m also a believer of the growth mindset, and this
          industry will prove how resilient I am to that belief because of the never-ending updates to all
          programming languages.
          <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, I had just completed a coding bootcamp and I’m pretty invested into this industry. My
          thinking is that there’s a silver lining through it all. I already enjoy making content, so now
          let’s add some code on top of it.
          <br>
          <br>
          Throughout the journey, I hope to gain insight, feedback to what you guys think I can improve on.
          The famous saying once goes, “There’s light at the end of the tunnel.” To be honest, I like the
          saying “What’s done in the dark shines in the light” a bit more. Hard work never goes unnoticed, and
          that wraps it up for this first blog post!

        <h2>Officially an Amazonian!</h2>
        <h4>December 5, 2021</h4>
        <p>I just started working at Amazon. It’s refreshing to be back on the payroll, but even more so to be working
          with people again. I forgot how organized and procedural the American system is when it comes to work. I’ve
          literally not worked in this country for the last 5 years, while being abroad in China but more on that later.
          To clarify, I work as a warehouse associate packing and inspecting your guys’ packages! Making sure your items
          aren’t damaged and if it is, reporting it in a timely manner. There’s a whole gang of employees working in
          different departments of the warehouse. It’s fascinating to see how everything operates inside. That’s the
          biggest reason I took on this job.
          <br>
          <br>
          It’s training week, but so far everything from cleanliness, lighting, coloring, safety precautions and general
          work environment vibe checks out. The atmosphere in there is a bunch of young adults aged from 18-34 and to
          keep things lively and not so dull and repetitive, the warehouse is blasted with 90s classic jams. It almost
          feels like a club in there.
          <br>
          <br>
          I only realized during the orientation how much benefits Amazon employees receives. They have an incentive
          where if you work with them for a year full-time, you get qualified for a tuition reimbursement of up to
          $12-13k with the assistance of placing you in a career track. The absurd amount of PTO they give you, even for
          part-time employees like myself, is another cool perk.
          <br>
          <br>
          In all honesty, one of the first things I thought of stepping inside with my yellow vest, gloves and
          protective gear -- not to mention all the delivery sprinter vans lined up outside of the warehouse -- was
          Squid Game.
          <br>
          <br>
          Catch you guys in the next one, see ya!

        <h2>First post of 2022..</h2>
        <h4>February 23, 2022</h4>
        <p>
          Wow -- This word has stuck with me since childhood and it's an expression you can never go wrong with.
          <br>
          <br>
          There's a lot going on leading up to this part of the post alone. Let's break it down a bit. It's been nearly
          3
          months
          since I last pushed a blog post and since then, I quit Amazon -- only lasted there for a few weeks. Didn't
          really feel like
          working during the holidays, and that's exactly what I did -- not work and celebrate with family. Well worth
          it, but
          my credit cards say otherwise.
          <br>
          <br>
          I now work for Revature! A company that chews you up for little pay and moves you around the country where
          need be (after training).
          I'm in training right now and boy, is it starting to really feel like hell -- deadlines, weekly assessments,
          weekly oral interview-style
          test questions about what you've learned in the past week, coding projects and I'm stressing over the first
          one due in one week from now.
          <br>
          <br>
          Work is fully remote and now I can see why Americans have fallen in love with this "work-environment." It's
          almost too comforting, but I hope
          I'm able to move with Revature and actually go out the east of this country. And while I might not be
          explaining
          too much about the company I work for,
          that isn't really the point of this post. It's really just to rant as to what's happened with my code and this
          blog in the last few months.
          <br>
          <br>
          This project that's due in a month is critical to this training program and I'm just really hoping to perform
          well and make my code the most functional
          it could be. I'm coding in Java and it's all back-end logic. And here I was thinking I'm going to be a
          front-end developer. What a sudden change of life
          events in just these few months alone. I didn't really have to shotgun approach the application process, since
          Revature reached out, made me take an assesment,
          and in January I settled all the paper to hit the ground running the first of Feb.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's all I really have for tonight, and I can't forget these newly-create principles to live by, and that's
          to commit my code a lot more often. We live
          in a world where our social media presence is tracked and surprisingly enough, you can still do that in a
          positive manner, which I'm trying my best to practice.
